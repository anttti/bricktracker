They are useful to store "yes/no" info about a set and quickly set it. Once clicked the change is immediatly stored in the database. A visual indicator tells you the change was succesful.

## Default statuses

The original version of BrickTracker defined the following statuses

- Minifigures are collected
- Set is checked
- Set is collected and boxed

## Visibility

The statuses are **never visible** on the front page. The display here tries to be as minimalistic as possible.

Prior to version `1.1.0`, the statuses were visible both on the Grid view (**Sets**) and the details of a set.

From version `1.1.0`, it is possible to decide if a status is visible from the Grid or not. It will always be visible in a set details.

### Change the visibility of a status

To change the visibility of a status, head to the **Admin page** and open the **Set statuses** section.

Simply click on the **Displayed on the Set Grid** status to select whether it is displayed or not. The change is immediately saved to the database.

In this example, we have decided to have no status visible on the Grid view.
